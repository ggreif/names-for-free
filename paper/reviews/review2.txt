OVERALL EVALUATION: 2 (accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 3 (medium)

----------- REVIEW -----------
> The paper presents a technique for representing names and binders,
> enriching de Bruijn indices with types that encode the context in which
> they are valid. Although the general underlying idea is not new (e.g.
> the authors acknowledge the similarity of their technique to McBrides
> approach -- a connection that could be worth elaborating a bit more), I
> think the particular approach using rich types is very elegant, and the
> implementation of the interface seems fit for publication.

> A small note: Instead of the appendix (which violates the page
> restriction anyway), it would be nice to have a link to the code, if
> available.

> Typos:
> [Abstract] terms construction -> term construction
> [5]  that a that a term representation -> that a term representation
> [6]  or ExistScope) -> or ExistScope
> [7]  as it and relies -> as it relies
> [10] are less precise ours -> are less precise than ours
> [11] with one less free variables -> with one less free variable
> [11] one can one can easily -> one can easily
> [11] gain can is -> gain is
> [11] We the notation -> We use the notation
