The two most used techniques to represent names (and the associated
binders) are atoms and de Bruijn indices. We propose a novel
representation bindings, whose dynamic (run-time) repsentation is
based on de Bruijn indices, but uses static (type-system) features to
offer a nominal-style interface for construction and manipulation of
binders. The key idea is to represent a subterm with an additional
free variable either as $\forall v. v \rightarrow \mathsf{Term} (a + v)$
or $\exists v. v \times \mathsf{Term} (a + v)$.
Using this approach one gets the
combined expressive power of nominal and de Bruijn indices, as we demonstrate on a 
number of examples.
